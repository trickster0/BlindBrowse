# BlindBrowse
Android BlindBrowse : Real Time Navigation on Android devices with no display.


BlindBrowse supports ADB and SSH protocol. SSH is not tested very thoroughly but it should work okay, so ADB is recommended.

***Updated to see the coordinates on the webserver***
***Refreshing the Browser is not needed!***


<strong>USAGE:</strong>
<p>
<pre><code>python blindbrowse.py
</code></pre>

# Why would this be helpful?
Some IoT devices have ADB debugging interface or rarely SSH but not display.
This would help you browse the device and change settings or other things.
